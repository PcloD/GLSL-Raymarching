A real-time GPU ray marcher in GLSL and C++

Most of the ray marching code is processed a fragment shader, the automation system uses kiwi (http://github.com/nical/kiwi).

This project is a school project for the Techical Universtiy of Denmark made with Michele Bianchi (https://github.com/Jazzinghen).

As seen in the third and fourth pictures we implemented some Post Effects such as Depth of Field and Edge Detection.

The last image shows one of the possible results with the node compositor.
