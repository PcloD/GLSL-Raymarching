A real-time GPU ray marcher in GLSL and C++

Most of the ray marching code is processed a fragment shader, the automation system uses kiwi (http://github.com/nical/kiwi).

This project is a school project for the Techical Universtiy of Denmark made with Michele Bianchi (https://github.com/Jazzinghen).

As seen in the third picture we implemented some Post Effects such as Depth of Field and Edge Detection.
